/*
batch.size: When multiple records are sent to the same partition, the producer will batch them together.
This parameter controls the amount of memory in bytes that will be used for each batch.
When the batch is full, all the messages in the batch will be sent
This does not mean that the producer will wait for the batch to become full. The producer will send half-full batches and even batches with just a single message in them


linger.ms: amount of time to wait for additional messages before sending the current batch
* KafkaProducer sends a batch of messages either when the current batch is full or when the linger.ms limit is reached
* By default, the producer will send messages as soon as there is a sender thread available to send them, even if thereâ€™s just one message in the batch
* By setting linger.ms higher than 0, we instruct the producer to wait a few milliseconds to add additional messages to the batch before sending it to the brokers.
* This increases latency but also increases throughput (because we send more messages at once, there is less overhead per message)
